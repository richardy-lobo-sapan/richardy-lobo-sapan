### Full bio

Hi, my name is Richard (20). I'm a final year mathematics student at University of Indonesia (Expected 2023).

Back in 2019, I had an everlasting question after spending months in Mathematics department: "Would I imagine myself as a Mathematician in 4 years?". Although I followed the classes pretty well, I did not find the full enjoyment in exploring it. This allows me to explore myself in various fields and the world of business and strategy has been on top of my mind in these past years. It led me to pursue professional exposure through internship opportunities and competitions, including Product Management Intern at SejutaCita and The 1st winner of Waste-to-Energy Global Case Competition by the International Youth Summit for Renewable Energy, which actually led me to received the most outstanding student award in my department 

As for my future, I hope to one day work as a dta scientist, a product manager, or a venture capitalist and work with a diverse team. I also do not rule out the possibilities of working in other fields. In my free time, I usually spend my time watching anime or movie, any genre. Sometimes, I also join competitions, especially those related to data or business cases. Sometimes I win, but most of the time I lose. Even so, I still learned a lot, especially about grit and perseverance

My main strength is in data analysis and number related stuff. The programming languages â€‹â€‹I usually use are Python, SQL, and R. I've done several projects like stock trading robot, OCR, face recognition, and etc. in the past. Right now, I'm currently into the idea of computer vision and am currently doing projects on that topic  In addition to that, I also really care about self-development. I am always looking for opportunities to continuously improve my soft skills, be it through networking, competitions, mentoring, and so on.
